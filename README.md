# Blockchain

This project is a basic implementation of a blockchain using Python. It includes core blockchain components such as blocks, transactions, and a consensus mechanism (Proof of Stake). The project also features key management, transaction validation, block validation, and basic smart contract support.

## Features

- **Blocks**: Data structures that store transactions and other relevant information.
  
- **Transactions**: Mechanisms for transferring value between participants.
  
- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism to secure the blockchain.
  
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of transactions using `ecdsa`.
  
- **Blockchain Validation**: Methods to ensure the integrity of the entire blockchain.
  
- **Smart Contracts**: Basic support for executing smart contracts.
  
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage using `cryptography.fernet`.
  
- **Double-Spending Prevention**: Mechanisms to prevent double-spending.
